        <h1 id="exegesis-of-the-plane-scene">Exegesis of the Plane Scene</h1>
<p>Scholars of the Torah interpret the holy text by Pardes, a Hebrew
acronym for Peshat (פְּשָׁט‎), Remez (רֶמֶז‎), Derash (דְּרַשׁ‎), and Sod (סוֹד‎), four
successively deeper levels for extracting meaning. We can use such a
technique to interpret the famous film Plane Scene by Bravo Nolan,
specifically the cryptic exchange between CIA and Bane, to discover the
underlying interaction between their characters:</p>
<pre><code>    CIA
At least you can talk. Who are you?

    BANE
It doesn&#39;t matter who we are. What 
matters is our plan.

    CIA
If I pull that off, will you die?

    BANE
It would be extremely painful.

    CIA
You&#39;re a big guy.

    BANE
For you.</code></pre>
<h2 id="peshat">Peshat</h2>
<p>Peshat refers to the literal meaning of the text. Without remembering
the Peshat, we can become lost and attempt to extract meaning where
there is none. Literally, Bane tells CIA that if CIA were to attempt to
remove his mask, Bane would cause extreme pain to CIA, which we assume
is a threat of violence.</p>
<h2 id="remez">Remez</h2>
<p>Remez is the “hints” of the text, lying just beneath the Peshat.
Bane’s intonation of “For you” implies that, rather than threatening
violence against CIA, Bane is a big guy compared to CIA.</p>
<h2 id="derash">Derash</h2>
<p>Derash tells us to search beyond this text for similar situations to
find comparative meaning. Studying the Hebrew connections in the script,
we find that Dr. Pavel’s name comes from the Hebrew name Paul, meaning
small and humble. CIA’s initial greeting to Dr. Pavel (“Dr. Pavel, I’m
CIA”) and his power stance can be interpreted as “Mr. Small, I’m CIA,”
or, “Instead of small, I am CIA.” By futher comparing this to the Remez
understanding, we can see that CIA’s bigness is continually called into
question, and it may be his telos to discover his natural size for
himself.</p>
<h2 id="sod">Sod</h2>
<p>The final and deepest meaning, Sod, is the mystic or secret meaning
of the text. By studying the hinted letters and interpreting them in a
new form, one may reveal the secret meaning. Bane’s line “For you” could
instead mean “Four U,” referring to the four U’s that are spoken in the
preceding two lines. This revelation is stunning, and yet some would
seek to stain Bravo Nolan’s genius by clinging to the Autistic Bane
hypothesis, that Bane is undergoing sensory overload and blurts out a
random fact about their dialogue. Although this explains Bane’s stilted
speech, it ignores another fact: the words that contain the U’s are
“would,” “painful,” “you’re,” and “guy.” The jewish gematria of these
four words is 2852, which also means “CIA Savior Survivor.” Thus, we are
pointed to a later exchange in the Plane Scene:</p>
<pre><code>    CIA
Well congratulations, you got
yourselves caught. What&#39;s the next
step of your master plan?

    Bane
Crashing this plane...  with no 
survivors!</code></pre>
<p>Bane’s intent is to destroy the Wreckage Brother and eliminate all
“Savior survivors,” a people who have seen no discussion in Plane Scene
literature, and, we assume, seek to escape Bane’s wrath and save figures
such as Dr. Pavel who are important to the Hothead cause.</p>

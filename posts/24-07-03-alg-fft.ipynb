    "# Algebraic FFTs\n",
    "\n",
    "The [FFT][FFT] (\"Fast Fourier Transform\") is one of the greatest algorithms of all time, but most have only seen it in its classical form, as transforming discrete samples in the time domain to their complex representation in the frequency domain. Its cousin the [NTT][NTT] (\"Number Theoretic Transform\"), which interpolates polynomials on modular numbers, is much less well known but still in common use, mostly for cryptography.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, even more exotic \"FFTs\" have been invented for specialized purposes, over stranger domains and with unfamiliar properties. In this post I'll illustrate the single algorithm underlying any FFT, and then go through a quick survey of these exotic FFTs and show how we can implement them by plugging in a small set of parameters to our common algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately we'll see that an FFT allows us to **change the basis** of a function defined on $N$ points in $N\\log(N)$ time. The naive method would be to change the basis by applying the linear transformation matrix, and matrix multiplication takes ~ $N^3$ time, so this is a huge advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few notes before we go any further:\n",
    "\n",
    "- I refer to **an** FFT as a set of parameters that allow us to apply the *FFT algorithm*. This is slightly confusing at first but quickly becomes less ambiguous and more convenient. For clarity, I only refer to the well-known FFT on the complex plane as the *classical FFT*.\n",
    "- $N$ always means $2^n$, usually when the exponent becomes too small.\n",
    "- I use a lot of subscripts, so vector indices are indicated by superscripts $\\vec{v}^{(i)}$. Subscripts $\\vec{v}_n$ indicate labels or parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "This post was written as a Sage notebook. I've written a few utility functions, but their meaning should be clear from their names. The only strange one is `bind` - this lets me add methods to a class after definition, so I can write prose in between.\n",
